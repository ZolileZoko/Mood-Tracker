# Mood Tracker

A minimalist mood-tracking app designed to help users monitor their emotional well-being over time. This project is part of my personal journey to explore **full-stack development**, while focusing on **interactive UI**, **clean UX**, and **data visualization**.

## Features

-  Log daily mood entries with custom notes
-  Visualize trends over time (line charts)
-  Toggle between dark and nude color themes
-  Local data persistence ( file-based back-end)
-  Built as a practice project to learn modern web development
